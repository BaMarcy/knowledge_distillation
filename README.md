#### 🔍 Description
<p align="justify">Multi-task learning is a subfield of Deep Learning in which multiple learning tasks (e.g. age and gender and ethnicity classification) are solved at the same time, while exploiting commonalities and differences across tasks. Transfer learning, on the other hand, is the reuse of pre-trained models (e.g. VGG16 RESNET18 and RESNET34) on a new problem. It's a very popular technique because it can train ANNs faster with comparatively little data. This project implements these two powerful techniques in PyTorch on FAIRFACE dataset to classify gender, ethnicity and age within a single model.</p>
